Hello,
    I added ranged combat, new weapons with the ranged weapon type, and the ability to cast a spell.
    This can be accessed from the keybind 'L' (to start inspecting, ranged attacking, or magic attacking a monster).
    I also made sure that when attacking with magic or a ranged weapon, to continue next turns for NPCs and to check for weapon types.

Thanks,
Jamey
